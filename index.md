# [F-CHAT](https://f-chat-26177.web.app/)
## What is this page?
So i have decided to blog every fun thing i do, on the internet so as to have a log.  
By doing this i expect to well document progress of my work, which i can utilize to improve my performance in future endeavours.  

## F-CHAT
So coming to F-Chat, what is the idea behind the creation of such a technology? Why do we need it? How does it help?  
Here we are going to answer all of these questions for you.  

This is the implementation of the concept of Decentralization in its true form.  
Here we use a Chat System which is built on top of a database which is distributed across a number of devices and uses resources provided by those devices and uses that to run the  application thus removing the need of a centralized database.The real reason to use decentralized database is because it provides security in the best form when it is paired with end to end encryption making it very tedious for an attack to disintegrate the system.  

I had taken up this project as a part of my curriculum in the Fall semester of the third year of my engineering.I have documented this pretty well in the project report that i will be putting down here:

The live production of this current version of the application is available at: [F-chat](https://f-chat-26177.web.app/)


## What next?
So i have been in contact with a professor at my university and he has given me certain pointers to further improve the chat system.  
* Add AES encryption standard implemented by me to the chat system.
* Create Group chat option so people can chat with a certain set of people instead of a global chat system.

## Current Work
I have decided to document everyday progress followed by a weekly review of the project on this blog page.
